## Contraints

Keep startup time <= 0.12 s.

* With zgen this is only possible by manually managing the init process.


## Principles

Do not break what people are used to. Augment, do not change. Examples:

* `cd` should behave as people expect, but enhancd breaks it by default.
* `..` should go to parent dir.
